Set/Map Comparison
==================

TreeMap v. TreeSet
------------------

- Treeset is implemented using Treemap
- Treeset stores the actual objects
- Treeset implements Set interface
- Treeset does not allow duplicate objects
- Treemap stores the keys of the values
- Treemap implements Map interface
- Treemap allows duplicate values
- Treeset and Treemap both have a natural ordering, making most of their operations O(log(n)) time

Speed Comparison
----------------

- Hashmap operations were much faster than Treemap
- Hashmap operations have constant time
- Treemap operations have O(log(n)) time

Java's Version of Heap
----------------------

Java's implementation of heap is called *Priority Queue*
